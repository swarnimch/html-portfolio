Hi! I'm Swarnim Chettri â€” an editor by profession and a web developer in the making. My background in editing has sharpened my attention to detail and storytelling skills, which I now channel into building clean, user-friendly, and accessible websites. I am passionate about combining creativity with technology to craft meaningful digital experiences. As I continue to learn and grow in web development, I am excited to bring my editorial mindset and design sensibility into every project I create.
